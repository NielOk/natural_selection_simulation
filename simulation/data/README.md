Here is some more information about the databases. 

database_1 used environment configs from environment_1.json and organism configs from organism_config_1.json, as well as the simulation parameters 2 simulations, with each simulation going for 10 generations. With this one, we want to ask, with 10 generations in this simulation, will two exactly similar populations in exactly similar conditions diverge (which would be unexpected) or look like the same populations after 10 generations? 

database_2 used environment configs from environment_1.json and organism configs from organism_config_1.json, as well as the simulation parameters 2 simulations, but with each simulation going for only 1 generation. With this one, we want to ask, with 1 generation in this simulation, will two exactly similar populations in exactly similar conditions diverge (unexpected) or look like the same populations after 1 generation? 

database_3 used environment configs from environment_2.json and organism configs from organism_config_1.json, as well as the simulation parameter 1 simulation, with the simulation going for 20 generations. 

database_4 used environment configs from environment_1.json and organism configs from organism_config_1.json, as well as the simulation parameter 1 simulation, with the simulation going for 20 generations. database_3 and database_4 compared show us how two populations evolved for the same number of generations in two different environments (environment_1 being more plentiful in resources and less harsh while environment_2 is scarce in resources and more harsh) can be different.
